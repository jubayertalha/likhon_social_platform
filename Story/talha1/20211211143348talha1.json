{"title":"TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT","story":"Once, there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on the hillside. To entertain himself, he sang out, \u201cWolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen the villagers heard the cry, they came running up the hill to drive the wolf away. But, when they arrived, they saw no wolf. The boy was amused when seeing their angry faces.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t scream wolf, boy,\u201d warned the villagers, \u201cwhen there is no wolf!\u201d They angrily went back down the hill.\r\n\r\nLater, the shepherd boy cried out once again, \u201cWolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!\u201d To his amusement, he looked on as the villagers came running up the hill to scare the wolf away.\r\n\r\nAs they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly, \u201cSave your frightened cry for when there really is a wolf! Don\u2019t cry \u2018wolf\u2019 when there is no wolf!\u201d But the boy grinned at their words while they walked grumbling down the hill once more.\r\n\r\nLater, the boy saw a real wolf sneaking around his flock. Alarmed, he jumped on his feet and cried out as loud as he could, \u201cWolf! Wolf!\u201d But the villagers thought he was fooling them again, and so they didn\u2019t come to help.\r\n\r\nAt sunset, the villagers went looking for the boy who hadn\u2019t returned with their sheep. When they went up the hill, they found him weeping.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere really was a wolf here! The flock is gone! I cried out, \u2018Wolf!\u2019 but you didn\u2019t come,\u201d he wailed.\r\n\r\nAn old man went to comfort the boy. As he put his arm around him, he said, \u201cNobody believes a liar, even when he is telling the truth!\u201d"}
